# Optical Character Recognition

![Example](imgs/init.png)

This is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool that extracts characters from drawings. It's simply a deployment of the `chars` model from my [CNN writeup](https://github.com/intelligent-username/CNN). The OCR model is trained on the EMNIST dataset with a final accuracy of 95%. Note that, although 95% may seem low, it's actually very solid for EMNIST.
